# Million Good Ways â€“ Frontend

This package contains the React single-page application for Million Good Ways, a gallery of benevolent artificial super intelligence futures. It is built with Vite, React Router, Framer Motion, and custom styling to provide a rich, optimistic experience.

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev     # Start the Vite development server on http://localhost:5173
npm run build   # Create a production build in ./dist
npm run lint    # Lint the source files with ESLint
npm run preview # Preview the production build locally
```

The Vite dev server proxies API requests to `http://localhost:4000` so you can run the Express backend simultaneously without additional configuration.

For full documentation on how the frontend integrates with the backend, refer to the root-level [README](../README.md).
